# IoT Project: Heating System Regulator

## Overview

This project is an Internet of Things (IoT) application that monitors and regulates air temperature and humidity. Using the DHT11 sensor, the application collects real-time environmental data, stores it in Firebase, and provides a user-friendly interface for monitoring and control via HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Measures temperature and humidity using the DHT11 sensor.
- **Data Storage**: Stores collected data in Firebase for persistence.
- **User Interface**: Interactive frontend for displaying data and controlling parameters.
- **Regulation**: Allows users to set desired thresholds for temperature and humidity.

### Hardware

- **DHT11 Sensor**: Measures temperature and humidity.
- **Microcontroller**: NodeMCU for data transmission.

### Software

- **Firebase**: Cloud database for storing sensor data.
- **Frontend**: Built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
- **Backend Integration**: Communicates with Firebase for data storage and retrieval.
